# ☁️ Azure Resources

**Azure resources** are the building blocks of your cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure.  
These resources can include **Virtual Machines**, **Databases**, **Storage Accounts**, or any other Azure service.  
Each resource is a **manageable entity** that can be provisioned, configured, and monitored independently.

## 🧱 Resource Groups in Azure

A **Resource Group (RG)** in Azure is a **logical container** for resources that share the same lifecycle, permissions, and policies.  
It helps organize and manage related Azure resources efficiently — whether they belong to a specific application, project, or environment.

### 🔑 Key Points about Resource Groups

- **Lifecycle Management:**  
  Manage deployments, updates, and deletions for all resources within the group as a single unit.  

- **Resource Organization:**  
  Group resources by project, environment (Dev, Test, Prod), or application for better clarity.  

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  Define access permissions at the resource group level to control who can view, modify, or delete resources.

💡 *Tip: Deleting a resource group deletes all resources within it — handle with care!*

## ⚙️ Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

**Azure Resource Manager (ARM)** is the **deployment and management service** for Azure.  
It provides a consistent management layer for provisioning, updating, and organizing Azure resources through templates, APIs, or the Azure portal.

### 🌟 Key Features of Azure Resource Manager

- **📄 Template-Based Deployment:**  
  Use **ARM templates (JSON)** to define infrastructure and configurations — ensuring **repeatable and consistent** deployments.  

- **🔗 Dependency Management:**  
  ARM automatically handles dependencies, ensuring that resources are deployed in the correct order.  

- **♻️ Rollback and Roll-Forward:**  
  In case of deployment issues, ARM supports automatic rollback or continuation from the last successful state.  

- **🏷️ Tagging and Categorization:**  
  Apply tags to resources for easier **cost tracking**, **organization**, and **management**.
