# Basics of Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud?  
Think of the cloud as a vast, virtual space where you can **store files, run software, and access services over the internet**.  

It’s like having a powerful computer somewhere on the web that you can use without owning or managing the hardware. You can access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.

## What is Cloud Computing?  
Cloud computing is a model for **delivering computing services over the internet**. Instead of maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, users access resources, applications, and storage from:  

- **Public Cloud:** Provided by third-party providers, shared among multiple users.  
- **Private Cloud:** Managed internally for a single organization.  

Services are hosted in data centers around the world, offering flexibility to choose the deployment model that fits your needs.

## Types of Cloud

### Public Cloud
- **Who Uses It:** Individuals, businesses, organizations.  
- **What It’s Like:** A giant, shared computer space on the internet where anyone can access apps and files.  
- **Example:** Google Drive, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Private Cloud
- **Who Uses It:** A single organization.  
- **What It’s Like:** Your own private digital space — a secure “clubhouse” for your team.  
- **Example:** A company using its own servers for internal operations.

### Hybrid Cloud
- **Who Uses It:** Organizations needing a mix of private and public resources.  
- **What It’s Like:** Private space for sensitive data plus shared cloud resources for extra storage or tasks.  
- **Example:** Sensitive company data in private servers, backups on public cloud.

## In a Nutshell
- **Public Cloud:** Shared space for everyone.  
- **Private Cloud:** Exclusive space for your organization.  
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines private and public spaces for flexibility.
