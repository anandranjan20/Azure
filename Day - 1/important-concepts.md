# Vocabulary in Cloud Computing

## Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage, or network resources.

## Virtual Machine (VM)
A Virtual Machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.

## API (Application Programming Interface)
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.

## Regions
Regions refer to geographic locations where cloud providers maintain data centers. Each region typically contains multiple data centers.

## Availability Zones (AZs)
Availability Zones are isolated locations within a region with their own power, cooling, and networking. They ensure **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.

## Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increasing workloads or to be expanded to accommodate growth.

## Elasticity
Elasticity is the capability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand.

## Agility
Agility is the ability to quickly adapt to changes, including rapid deployment of resources and applications in cloud environments.

## High Availability (HA)
High Availability ensures that a system or application is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.

## Fault Tolerance
Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption despite hardware or software failures.

## Disaster Recovery (DR)
Disaster Recovery involves planning and processes for restoring data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.

## Load Balancing
Load Balancing distributes network traffic or computing workloads across multiple servers to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed.
