# Basics of Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud?  
Think of the cloud as a vast, virtual space where you can **store files, run software, and access services over the internet**.  

It’s like having a powerful computer somewhere on the web that you can use without owning or managing the hardware. You can access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.

## What is Cloud Computing?  
Cloud computing is a model for **delivering computing services over the internet**. Instead of maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, users access resources, applications, and storage from:  

- **Public Cloud:** Provided by third-party providers, shared among multiple users.  
- **Private Cloud:** Managed internally for a single organization.  

Services are hosted in data centers around the world, offering flexibility to choose the deployment model that fits your needs.
