# IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS in Azure

Cloud services in Azure are typically offered in three main models: **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS**. Each model provides a different level of control, flexibility, and management responsibility.

## 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
IaaS provides **virtualized computing resources** over the internet. You manage operating systems, applications, and storage, while the cloud provider manages the hardware.  

- **What You Manage:** OS, apps, data, runtime  
- **What Azure Manages:** Hardware, networking, virtualization  
- **Use Case:** Hosting virtual machines, storage, and networking infrastructure  
- **Examples in Azure:** Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage, Azure Virtual Network

## 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
PaaS provides a **ready-to-use platform** for building, deploying, and managing applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  

- **What You Manage:** Applications and data  
- **What Azure Manages:** OS, runtime, middleware, virtualization, networking, storage  
- **Use Case:** Developing web apps, APIs, and mobile backends  
- **Examples in Azure:** Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions

## 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
SaaS delivers **fully managed applications** over the internet. You use the software without worrying about installation, maintenance, or infrastructure.  

- **What You Manage:** Just user settings and data (optional)  
- **What Azure Manages:** Everything else (app, runtime, OS, infrastructure)  
- **Use Case:** Email, collaboration tools, CRM, ERP  
- **Examples in Azure:** Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power BI

| Feature               | IaaS                     | PaaS                     | SaaS                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Control               | High (OS, apps, data)   | Medium (apps, data)     | Low (just usage/data)    |
| Management Responsibility | You                       | Partial                  | Minimal                  |
| Examples              | Azure VMs, Azure Storage | Azure App Service, Azure SQL | Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 |
| Use Case              | Virtual servers, storage | App development         | Ready-to-use software    |
